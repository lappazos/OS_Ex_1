Assigment 1:
The program receive 1 argument. The Program open the following directory Welcome/To, with full
permissions for user and group, where
 others have no permission to write. than a file is created named OS2020, with no permissions to
 execute (make sense because it's not an executable file). The following is written:
 "<username>
 if you have'nt read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
 <user_input>"
 Than, the file is deleted, so as the directories created, and the program leaved no mark.
